**Captson Project Implementation:**

**Details:**
# **Use of React:**
`	`Using this Javascript framework, data would be fetched using APIs in Json format. All the front end, backend, etc. would be built using this. 
# **Use of Postman**
`	`Using the postman, the doubt-fire API would be tested. The correct endpoints would be ascertained using the same tool as well.
# **Why holding data in buffer?** 
`	`The data is stored already on to the servers of doubt-fire, therefore, fetching it and then saving it again then performing analysis would be costlier task than to just analyze the data. 
# **Machine Learning Models:**
`	`For training of Machine Learning models, the data would be fetched and temporarily stored and then model would predict new values and learn from it as well. The final model would be used by javascript backend to predict and fit the model again.
# **Use of Python**
`	`Python would be mainly used for training of AI models. Once trained, the models would be exported and be made available for prediction of new data. 

**Test Run**
# **Creation of an API** 
In order to mimic what is being done with doubt-fire, a simulator/prototype type of solution would be built using the above given technologies. Using the Javascript, **An API would be created** which would be working the same way as **doubt-fire** API. 
# **Dummy Data and Python**
`	`Using the dummy data, a machine learning model would be trained and exported in a way that is usable by javascript backend for the predictions. **Faker** library of python would be very useful in this regard. 
# **React Backend and Front-end**
`	`Backend and front end of the test application would be built using react. The backend would be built essentially to get data from doubt-fire servers using APIs and perform analysis. The analysis would be presented on the front end.
# **Github**
`	`The test application would be published on Github.
